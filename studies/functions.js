 /* FUNCTIONS

 0. An overview of functions is provided in that datatypes.js file. This section go into further detail.

 1. The first phase of using functions is to 'create' the function, also known as 'defining' it.  This means 
 thinking up a name that's easy to type and easy to remember what purpose it serves. Next is deciding what parameters 
 it needs (which will need names of their own). 
 
 The second phase is putting that function into action by calling it. Now, in place of the parameters, arguements are 
 entered, and the action is executed.
